# Identifying States of a Financial Market

This is a Python implementation of the clustering algorithm described in the paper "Identifying States of a Financial Market" by M체nnix, M., Shimada, T., Sch채fer, R. et al. The algorithm aims to identify "market states" based on the correlation structure of financial data, and can be used to detect points of drastic change in the market and map them to occurrences of financial crises.
